# k6 load testing tool

In this repository are `JavaScript` files for REST API load testing with [k6](https://k6.io/). 

Representational Stateless Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API) is a web service that allows interaction with cloud resources using HTTP requests. We use `JavaScript` to write the test scripts and load our exposed REST API endpoints with `k6`. 

To run the [load files](../k6-linux/), you need to install `k6` on your machine. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/).

## Running the load tests

Run these commands in the terminal to run the load tests:

```bash
k6 run [file_name].js or 
```
or
```bash
k6 run --vus 10 --duration 60s [file_name].js
```
As seen in one sample in the picture below, K6 generates and presents a thorough summary of the aggregated results at the end of a test.

The `k6` load testing results are comprehensively compiled from end-of-test summary reports for each chaincode function. These reports detail aggregate statistics for the primary aspects of the test. As illustrated in the subsequent tables: 
* A single table represents the test results for a single region and 
* Three separate tables depict the test results for three distinct regions.
